Description:
  This is a bot written to capture YouTube videos based on URL or video ID and store them in a playlist to play through a Discord server voice channel. Most of the code in this project is heavily inspired by agubelu and his discord_music_bot (https://github.com/agubelu/discord-music-bot).
